const fs = require('fs');

function read(err, data){
    console.log(data);
}

const a = fs.readFile("a.txt", "utf-8", read); // asynchronous

const b = fs.readFile("b.txt", "utf-8", read);

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Timeout reached");
}, 0);

console.log("This is the end of the script");

// the output will first be "This is the end of the script",
// then "Timeout reached", and finally the contents of a.txt and b.txt  
// because the readFile function is asynchronous and the timeout is set to 0.
// The read function will be called with the contents of the files once they are read.
// If there is an error reading the files, it will be passed to the read function as the first argument.
// If the files are not found, the error will be logged to the console.
// If the files are found, their contents will be logged to the console.
// The order of the output may vary depending on the timing of the file reads and the timeout
